# 🗃️ 404NotGone

**Preserving useful software when the original disappears.**

The **404NotGone** GitHub organization exists to **archive, mirror, and preserve** open source projects that are no longer available at their original upstream locations. Whether due to domain lapses, repo deletions, or maintainers moving on, too many valuable projects vanish — and we believe they shouldn't be lost to time.

## 🌍 What We Do

We:

- 📦 Host **archived mirrors** of projects that were once public but have since disappeared  
- 🧭 Preserve **final tagged releases** and associated documentation  
- 🛠️ Keep software **accessible for package maintainers, developers, and researchers**  
- 💬 Welcome context and historical knowledge from anyone who was involved in or used these projects

> Our goal is not to fork or actively maintain these projects — but to ensure they remain available for the community.

## 🤝 How You Can Help

- **Know a project that vanished?** Open an issue or start a discussion — we’re happy to help preserve it.
- **Have historical context or missing documentation/code?** We'd love your input.
- **Want to build on a preserved project?** Fork it! That’s what this is here for.

We believe code should live on — even when the original maintainers move on.

## 🕊️ Credit & Respect

All preserved repositories include attribution when known. If you're a former maintainer and want your project removed or updated, [open a request](https://github.com/404NotGone/.github/issues) — we respect your rights and wishes.
